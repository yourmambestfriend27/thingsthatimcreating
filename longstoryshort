# Basically 'Different seasons' summary by Stephen King was used to calculate how many long and short words was used.
text = '''
King's first collection of novellas has a more dramatic than horrific bent.\
Indeed, its first story inspired the popular film (and an obsession with Morgan Freeman’s voice): The Shawshank Redemption.\
And while “Apt Pupil” and “The Breathing Method” could still very much be considered scary,\
Different Seasons stands out for the lack of sinister supernatural beings or luridly horrific images that have become staples of some of the other Stephen King short stories.\
